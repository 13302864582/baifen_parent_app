ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => library_websocketclient\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => library_websocketclient\src\main\assets
* libs\jackson-core-asl-1.9.7.jar => library_websocketclient\libs\jackson-core-asl-1.9.7.jar
* libs\jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.7.jar => library_websocketclient\libs\jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.7.jar
* lint.xml => library_websocketclient\lint.xml
* res\ => library_websocketclient\src\main\res
* src\ => library_websocketclient\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
